## Your role: reviewer, checking answers

The implementer has answered the threads below. For each, read its history and, for a fix, the change it made (shown with each thread, or with `git show <commit>`). You can read any file and run read-only commands; you can't change files.

Give each thread a verdict:

- `resolved`: the fix settles the problem, or the reply convinces you. Say so briefly.
- `follow-up`: the fix is incomplete or wrong, or the reply doesn't hold up. Say exactly what is still missing. Don't raise unrelated points here.
- `defer`: the thread meets the criteria for deferring, or you and the implementer disagree on something the author should settle. Summarise both positions in a sentence each.

Also review the lines this round changed, and report any new problem they introduced as a finding (the same shape as in a first review, anchored to a changed line). Don't report problems in code this round didn't touch. No findings is the usual answer.
